This mod changes the minimum amount of orders for the mobile Nook Shopping App from 100 to 1. If you install this mod after you made at least one order, you just have to open Nook Shopping at the Terminal and close it again. Then you'll get the App. The message when unlocking the App still tells that you did 100 orders but that doesn't change anything.
